1. exercise for 5th Dec 2019
============================

Writing out instructions is a basic skill to identify the steps required to
complete a task. It is a tool to document what needs to get done in order to 
get something done. It also helps us to understand the program-flow, e.g. the 
correct sequence of the required steps.

Creating top level flowcharts and sub level flowcharts help us to break up
larger tasks into smaller tasks. When coding we talk about solving problems
by writing code. Smaller problems are easier to solve than larger (more complex)
problems.

This morning we will practice:
 a) identifying instructions steps, and 
 b) documenting program-flows.

We start by revisiting the Christmas party for your sports club. Consider the 
items and steps required for scheduling meetings. With the help from feedback
that you have received and our flowchart lessons, review your instructions from 
last week.

Remember that the actual problem is to schedule meetings. Your solution should
include options to schedule a new meeting, modify an existing meeting, and
cancel meetings.

 1. List all the items required for completing the task.
 
 2. List all the steps you need to take for completing the task.
 
 3. Order the steps in a appropriate sequence for a successful task completion. 

 4. Create a top-level flowchart for creating meetings.
 
 5. Create sub-level flowchart to break down processes from your top-level
    flowchart.

 6. Update this file by adding a HTML comment with your findings from this
    exercise. Ensure to include your notes for the previous steps (1. - 3.)

 7. Upload the completed file to your GitHub repository.
