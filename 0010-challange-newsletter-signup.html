3. and last exercise for 5th Dec 2019
=====================================

Writing out instructions is a basic skill to identify the steps required to
complete a task. It is a tool to document what needs to get done in order to 
get something done. It also helps us to understand the program-flow, e.g. the 
correct sequence of the required steps.

Creating top level flowcharts and sub level flowcharts help us to break up
larger tasks into smaller tasks. When coding we talk about solving problems
by writing code. Smaller problems are easier to solve than larger (more complex)
problems.

This morning we will practice:
 a) identifying instructions steps, and 
 b) documenting program-flows.

required system and features that you will need to provide.

 1. State your definition of the 'Problem Statement'.
 
 2. Create a top-level flowchart for creating meetings.
 
 3. Create sub-level flowcharts to break down processes from your top-level
    flowchart.
