   Above code utilizes many aspects of JavaScript and we
   will learn about them as we progress with our course.
   For now we just need to be familiar with two processes:
   1.) OUTPUT, a mechanism to output the final and interim
       results of our script.
   2.) INPUT, a mechanism to enter words and numbers.
