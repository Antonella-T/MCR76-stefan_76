4. exercise for 12th Dec 2019
=====================================

This morning we will practice:
 a) identifying instructions steps, 
 b) documenting program-flows, and
 c) JS syntax.

File:  0014-arrays-typeof-and-isarray.htmls
Time:  45 minutes allowance
Level: Challanging


Reuse your script from the "0012-array-of-items.html" exercise. Add the two
lines of code at the end of your script:

console.log(typeof MYARRAY)   // replace MYARRAY with the variable name of your array
console.log(Array.isArray(MYARRAY))   // replace MYARRAY with the variable name of your array

Observe the console output, what data type does the code in the second line return?
