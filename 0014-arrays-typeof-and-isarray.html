=====================================

This morning we will practice:
 a) identifying instructions steps, 
 b) documenting program-flows, and
 c) JS syntax.

File:  0014-arrays-typeof-and-isarray.htmls
Time:  45 minutes allowance
Level: Challanging


Reuse your script from the "0012-array-of-items.html" exercise. Add the two
lines of code at the end of your script:

console.log(typeof MYARRAY)   // replace MYARRAY with the variable name of your array
console.log(Array.isArray(MYARRAY))   // replace MYARRAY with the variable name of your array

Observe the console output, what data type does the code in the second line return?

Review https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp and observe the alternative method
to create arrays. Concentrate on sections with these headings (Please skip over the headings
that are not listed below!):
  -What is an Array?
  -Creating an Array
  -Using the JavaScript Keyword new
  -Access the Elements of an Array
  -Changing an Array Element
  -Access the Full Array
  -Array Properties and Methods
  -Accessing the First Array Element
  -Accessing the Last Array Element
  -Adding Array Elements
  -Avoid new Array()
  
Attempt the exercises included on this page. Attempt to modify the examples to output
your results to the console, e.g. replace
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars[0];
with
      console.log(cars[0]);
  


 1. Update this file by adding a HTML comment with your findings from this exercise.
