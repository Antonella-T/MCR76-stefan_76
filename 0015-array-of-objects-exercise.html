Compose a script that creates an object with properties for name, phoneNumber 
and dob (Date-of-birth). Use sample/made-up values for each property. Create 
a array and assign object as first array element.

Now modify your object data and add each modified object as a new element to
your array. Repeat this process to create three different array elements.
