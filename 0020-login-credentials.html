2. exercise for 23rd Jan 2020
=============================

This morning we will practice:

 a) Function Design Recipe
 b) Conditional Statements

File:  0020-login-credentials.html

Time:  90 minutes allowance

Level: comfortable

Create a function that will return 'true' if a username and password validates
corrrectly. 

You will need to consider a stored username and a stored password, e.g. the 
credentials that have been assigned by the user manager at the time of the
user account creation.

You will also need to consider a entered username and a entered password, e.g. 
the credentials that have been entered by the user and need to be checked by
the function that you are required to create.

For this exercise, hardcode the stored username and stored password in to the 
function declaration. Consider one user account only, e.g. one username and
password combination.

Task:

 1. Use the folder structure that we used in class.
    
 2. Follow the Function Design Recipe to create your function.

 3. Create a flowchart to help designing your function declaration.

 4. Upload the completed files and folder as a zipped file to your GitHub repository.
    Ensure that all uploaded file names for this exercise start with '0020-'
