Task Description:
Build a page that that will allow to select the number of a div and a colour. 
On clicking a button, the background colour of the div with the selected number
will change to the selected colour. At the same time on each click, the colour
of each div will be logged in the console.

Suggested Build Steps:

 1. Build a HTML page, to include a HTML form and 24 small div elements. Give
    each div a number (1 - 24) and display this number close to, or inside,
    the div.
    
 2. Add an onclick event to the forms button, e.g.:
    <button onclick="changeColour(); return false;">Change colour</button>
    Ensure to add "return false;" to prevent a page load ('refesh').
    
 3. Create a flowchart or spoudocode to plan your code instructions.

 4. Design your changeColour() function. Remember the function will:
    a) Collect the form values for div number and colour
    b) Change the colour of the selected div
    c) Collect all the 24 div colours and create a log with these colours.

 5. Upload the completed files and folder as a zipped file to your GitHub repository.
    Ensure that all uploaded file names for this exercise start with '0021-'
