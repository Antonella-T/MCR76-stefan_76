1. exercise for 27th Feb 2020
=============================

This morning we will practice:
 a) Pseudocode / Flowcharting
 b) Function Design Recipe

File:  0024-collapse-expand-element.html
Time:  
Level: 


Task Description:
Build a HTML page with one heading and one paragraph. Design a script
that will collapse the paragraph to a height of 10px as soon as the heading 
is clicked. Once collapsed and the heading is re-clicked, the script will 
expand the height to it's original size.
  

10:30 UPDATE:

You got your script working and want to expand it's usage on the page.
Add two more headings and two more paragraphs to your page. Rework your script
that it'll collapse and expand a paragraph as soon as it's heading is clicked.
